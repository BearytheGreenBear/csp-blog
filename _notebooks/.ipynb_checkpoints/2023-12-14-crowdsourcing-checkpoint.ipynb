    "### Crowdsourcing\n",
    "Crowdsourcing is the action of acquirring work and information from a large group of people via the internet. This information can be obtained from social media and other forms of media throughout the internet. Crowdsourcing allows companies to work with people throughout the world and aquire a variety of different skills. \n",

    "# variations of crowdsourcing\n",
    "Idea Generation: Seeking ideas and suggestions from the crowd to solve a problem or improve a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microtasks: Breaking down a large task into smaller, manageable microtasks that can be distributed to a crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Funding: Crowdfunding platforms, where a crowd financially supports projects, products, or causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "ata Collection: Gathering and analyzing data through contributions from a large number of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Innovation: Involving external contributors in the innovation process of a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "# benefits of crowdsourcing\n",
    "Crowdsourcing is cost efficent because it allows access to talented workers without the need for a traditional workforce. Also, projects and work can be completed in a lesser amount of time due to the many contributors. Finally, the diversity of contributors can lead to innovative ideas and solutions that may have not emerged in a traditional setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of crowdsourcing\n",
    " A well-known example of crowdsourcing is the website Wikipedia. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia where anybody can contribute and add information onto the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "# drawbacks of crowdsourcing\n",
    "There might be complications when crowdsourcing such as difficulties in confidentiality and communication between the groups involved. There is also a slight chance of receiving low quality work if a collaborater misunderstands the project's requirements.\n",
    "## Popcorn Hack  \n",
    "How can organizations optimize crowdsoucing while minimizing the drawbacks?\n",
    ">Organizations can have some trusted individuals monitor/guide crowdsourcing (e.g. looking out for misinformation/malicious activity). In some scenerios, AI could also be used instead of people to monitor."

    "## Citizen Science  \n",
    "- Citizen Science is scientific research that the general population helps to conduct. Ordinary citizens, often non-scientists, help contribute data to research projects using computing devices.\n",
    "- Gives a wide range of people the ability to contribute to scientific studies which provides more diverse data.\n",
    "### Popcorn Hack  \n",
    "How do you believe participating in a citizen science project could enhance both scientific research and public engagement, and can you share any specific areas of scientific study where citizen science might make a significant impact in the future?\n",
    "> A citizen science project helps research, as there is a greater sample size of people to perform an experiment on, and helps public engagement as a community comes together to contribute towards a common goal. Some scientific experiments that try to solve global issues (e.g. relating to the enviornment or the economy) may benefit from having a greater sample size."

    "# Homework\n",
    "## Question 1  \n",
    "Explain the concept of crowdsourcing. Provide examples of how it is commonly used in different fields.\n",
    "> Crowdsourcing is where an organization releases a task/problem for the general public to help contribute too. Some examples are Wikipedia (information), Kickstarter (funding), and OpenStreetMap (Mapping).\n",
    "## Question 2  \n",
    "Discuss the benefits and challenges associated with crowdsourcing. How can organizations effectively harness the power of crowdsourcing while mitigating potential drawbacks?\n",
    "> Some benefits are diversity of a large crowd, the relatively-low cost, and innovation. Some downsides are privacy/security concerns, motivation, and quality. Some mitigation strategies include having clear guidlines, legal frameworks, and feeback systems for the public.\n",
    "## Question 3  \n",
    "Identify a real-world example of a successful crowdsourcing project. Explain the project, its goals, and the positive outcomes achieved through the collaboration of a large group of people.\n",
    "> NASA had a \"Clickworker\" project, where the public was tasked with identifying and marking craters on mars. NASA needed this data to create an automated crater-detector. They were able to develop the software in a very short amount of time. \n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "Create a hypothetical scenario where crowdsourcing could be applied to solve a specific problem. Describe the problem, the type of contributions you would seek from the crowd, and the potential impact of implementing the crowdsourced solution.\n",
    "> If a city wants to design an eco-friendly park, they can crowdsource inovated and diverse ideas through crowdsourcing. The public can contribue their expertise (e.g. architecture or biodiversity), and the community involvement brings the public togther (more passionate about the project). The benefits of crowdsourcing is that the park will have diverse ideas and align with both social and ecological needs."
