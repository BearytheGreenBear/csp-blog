    "### Team Teach (What I Learned + Reflection)\n",
    "\n",
    "I already had some experience with coding (especially in python) so much of the team teaches were review to me. However, I learned about some of these topics in greater depth. The following are some of are some of the topics/teachings that resonated most with me:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Boolean If**: Ironically, I learned a lot from my own team's team teach. I already understood the basics of different boolean operators (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) though when researching for more difficult material, I learned how to make more advanced gates from basic gates (e.g. making a XOR gate from only NAND gates). In addition, I do most of my coding in C++ nowadays, so it was helpful for me to learn how to implement the different built-in methods of boolean operators in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithms**: As an extracurricular activity, I do a lot of competitive programming in C++, and so I am very familiar with different algorithms. Honestly speaking, I think I could do a more comprehensive teaching about algorithms than the respective teams, though as just an introduction, I think my classmates did ok. Having a review on Big O Notation, Binary Search, etc. was still interesting, I guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classes/Objects**: I don't use classes/objects in competitive programming normally, so it was fun to learn about classes because there are a lot of applications of them in the real world (like OOP). The team teachs incoporating these were a great introduction to the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Libraries**: The libraries team teached focused on the random module a lot, and although I don't use random a lot in competitive programming, many different progjects can utilize random. Even in the passion project itself, I used a lot of different libraries."

    "1. **Assignment/Planning** First, my team (most likely the scrum master) will assign me something to do. For example, on Monday our scrum master might tell me to get a database working by the end of the week. I'll then create a basic plan/goal (see Week 8), as well as GitHub issues if applicable (e.g. for collaboration).\n",
    "2. **Testing/Development** Secondly, I would go to Jupyter Notebook to do testing. I like being able to run different parts of code at a time for two reasons: (1) it is easier to keep track of errors and (2) it is easier for documentational purposes. I'd start by asking ChatGPT what I want, though I'll typically have to editted it to my own needs, as well as research specific errors/bugs. (ChatGPT is a good way to get started, I just need to polish it myself).\n",
    "3. **Deployment** Finally, I would be able to share my Jupyter Notebook with my teammates, and together we'd implement it into our API. (Adding JSON, testing with Postman, connecting frontend with backend, etc.)"

Building the passion project allowed me to test with different python libraries, as well as learning about APIs. Also, deploying to AWS and using docker with Flask was another new experience. The team teaches were OK (I think most stuff was review for me). This was also the first time I coded something together with a team, and so from day one, using how to use Github with the commits/pulls was another vital skill I learned this trimester.\n",

This try I've been reluctant to move away from Python, as Python was my first programming language and one that I am very familiar with. Javascript/HTML/CSS are an equally useful (though different) aspect of code, and so I look towards that in Tri 2."
