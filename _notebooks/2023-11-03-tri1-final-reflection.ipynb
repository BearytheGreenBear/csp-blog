    "### Team Teach (What I Learned + Reflection)\n",
    "\n",
    "I already had some experience with coding (especially in python) so much of the team teaches were review to me. However, I learned about some of these topics in greater depth. The following are some of are some of the topics/teachings that resonated most with me:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Boolean If**: Ironically, I learned a lot from my own team's team teach. I already understood the basics of different boolean operators (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) though when researching for more difficult material, I learned how to make more advanced gates from basic gates (e.g. making a XOR gate from only NAND gates). In addition, I do most of my coding in C++ nowadays, so it was helpful for me to learn how to implement the different built-in methods of boolean operators in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithms**: As an extracurricular activity, I do a lot of competitive programming in C++, and so I am very familiar with different algorithms. Honestly speaking, I think I could do a more comprehensive teaching about algorithms than the respective teams, though as just an introduction, I think my classmates did ok. Having a review on Big O Notation, Binary Search, etc. was still interesting, I guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classes/Objects**: I don't use classes/objects in competitive programming normally, so it was fun to learn about classes because there are a lot of applications of them in the real world (like OOP). The team teachs incoporating these were a great introduction to the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Libraries**: The libraries team teached focused on the random module a lot, and although I don't use random a lot in competitive programming, many different progjects can utilize random. Even in the passion project itself, I used a lot of different libraries."
