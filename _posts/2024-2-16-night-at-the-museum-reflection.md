**What we did well...**
- Many people were interested in our chatbox/social media project.
- They were impressed by our login/sign-up capabilites (one key checkpoint for our project).
- Our UI was pretty clean overall.

**What we can improve on... (feedback)**
- Our like system is still a bit buggy, so we can try to fix the frontend to fix this issue. (Likes don't update without page refresh).
- We need to add functionality to be able to edit messages (work in the backend).
- We can improve UI like adding smaller icons instead of big buttons for like, reply, and edit.

I saw a CSA project which was a website where you can find jobs. I was very impressed by the clean frontend design and the different features the project had. Although the idea was simple, it was well executed in all its features (e.g. inputting users, display users, sorting users, etc.)

I wasn't able to see any projects outside of CS, as my group presented late (7:30pm), so all the other rooms had already closed.
